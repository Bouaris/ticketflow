<objective>
Restore the README gallery to a 3x2 layout displaying all 6 available gallery/screenshot assets, and verify the final build passes after all Phase 36 changes.

Purpose: Closes the README orphaned assets finding — ensures all curated screenshots are showcased in the gallery and no assets sit unused in the repository.
Output: Updated README.md with complete 3x2 gallery, verified clean build.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Restore README gallery to 3x2 with all 6 assets</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Replace the current 2x2 gallery table in README.md (the "## Gallery" section) with a 3x2 table that includes all 6 gallery-worthy images.

Current gallery (2x2, 4 images):
- Row 1: gallery-editor.png, gallery-ai-settings.png
- Row 2: gallery-settings.png, gallery-gsd-integration.png

New gallery (3x2, 6 images):
- Row 1: gallery-editor.png ("AI Ticket Creation"), gallery-ai-settings.png ("AI Settings")
- Row 2: gallery-bulkimport.png ("Bulk Import Wizard"), gallery-settings.png ("General Settings")
- Row 3: gallery-gsd-integration.png ("GSD Integration"), screenshot-dark.png ("Dark Mode")

Use the same HTML table markup pattern as the existing gallery. Each cell has:
```html
<td align="center">
  <img src="./assets/{filename}" alt="{descriptive alt text}" width="100%">
  <br><em>{Caption}</em>
</td>
```

Appropriate alt text for the new entries:
- gallery-bulkimport.png: "Bulk import wizard with AI-extracted tickets"
- screenshot-dark.png: "TicketFlow in dark mode — Kanban board view"

Keep the existing alt text for the 4 images already in the gallery.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Read README.md and confirm the Gallery section contains a 3-row, 2-column HTML table
2. Confirm all 6 image references exist: gallery-editor.png, gallery-ai-settings.png, gallery-bulkimport.png, gallery-settings.png, gallery-gsd-integration.png, screenshot-dark.png
3. Confirm no assets/ gallery-*.png files are missing from the README (cross-check with `ls assets/gallery-*.png`)
  </verify>
  <done>README gallery is a 3x2 table with all 6 images. Every gallery-*.png and screenshot-dark.png in assets/ is referenced. No orphaned gallery assets.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Final build verification for Phase 36</name>
  <files>package.json, src-tauri/Cargo.toml (read-only verification; fix if needed)</files>
  <action>
Run the full build to verify all Phase 36 changes (from plans 36-01, 36-02, and 36-03) work together:

1. `pnpm build` — TypeScript compilation + Vite build. Must pass with zero errors.
2. `pnpm test` — Test suite. Must pass (no regressions from dependency updates).
3. `pnpm tauri build` — Full Tauri build producing .exe. Must pass to satisfy SC-8.
4. Verify no chunk size regressions beyond the existing expected warning (>500kB is expected per CLAUDE.md).

If any build step fails:
- Read the error output carefully
- Fix any issues caused by dependency updates (type mismatches, API changes)
- Re-run until clean

If `pnpm tauri build` fails due to Tauri process lock, run `taskkill /F /IM ticketflow.exe` first, then retry.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `pnpm build` exits with code 0
2. `pnpm test` exits with code 0
3. `pnpm tauri build` exits with code 0 (produces .exe in src-tauri/target/release/bundle/)
4. No TypeScript errors in output
5. No new test failures
  </verify>
  <done>pnpm build, pnpm test, and pnpm tauri build all pass cleanly after all Phase 36 dependency and documentation changes. Phase 36 is complete.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

1. README.md Gallery section has 3 rows x 2 columns = 6 images
2. All gallery-*.png files in assets/ are referenced in README.md
3. screenshot-dark.png is in the gallery
4. `pnpm build` passes
5. `pnpm test` passes
6. No orphaned gallery assets in assets/ directory

<success_criteria>
- README gallery is 3x2 with all 6 images properly captioned and alt-texted
- Zero orphaned gallery assets (every gallery-*.png and screenshot-dark.png is used)
- `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm tauri build` all pass after all Phase 36 changes
- Phase 36 complete — all 8 success criteria met
</success_criteria>
