### Modified

## Deviations

- Asset set differs from original plan: `gallery-ai-chat.png` replaced by `gallery-bulkimport.png` and `gallery-gsd-integration.png` (user choice)
- Screenshots show French content (authentic project) instead of English demo content
- 10 assets total instead of planned 8 (2 extras: bulk import wizard, GSD integration)

## Self-Check: PASSED
- [x] GSD badge in README header badges row
- [x] "Built with GSD" section with .planning/ integration mention
- [x] Footer credits both Claude Code and GSD
- [x] All media assets exist with correct filenames
