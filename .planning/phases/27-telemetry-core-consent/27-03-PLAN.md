<objective>
Instrument all 15 core and secondary usage events across the codebase. Each event fires at the correct user action point with relevant context metadata. This delivers TELE-05 (10 core events) and TELE-06 (5 secondary events).

Purpose: Without instrumentation, the telemetry module is an empty pipe. This plan connects the pipe to the actual user interactions that matter for understanding app usage patterns.

Output: 7 modified files with `track()` calls at the correct action points.

  <name>Task 1: Instrument core events in ProjectWorkspace, AI module, and settings</name>
  <files>src/components/workspace/ProjectWorkspace.tsx, src/lib/ai.ts, src/lib/ai-health.ts</files>
  <action>
Instrument the 10 core events from TELE-05. Import `import { track } from '../../lib/telemetry'` (or `'./telemetry'` for lib files) in each file.

**Event-by-event instrumentation guide:**

Note: `app_launched`, `consent_granted`, and `consent_revoked` are already handled by Plan 27-02 (in App.tsx and AppSettingsModal.tsx). This task handles the remaining 7 core events.

**1. `project_opened`** — in `ProjectWorkspace.tsx`
Location: Inside the component's initialization useEffect (there should be one that runs on mount with projectPath as dependency, or add a new one-time effect).
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  track('project_opened', {
    has_items: items.length > 0,
    item_count: items.length,
  });
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps — fire once on mount only
}, []);
```
Note: This fires once when ProjectWorkspace mounts (per project). Since ProjectWorkspace is keyed by projectPath, it remounts on project change.
IMPORTANT: `items` may not be loaded yet on first render. Instead, fire this in a useEffect that depends on `backlog.isLoading`:
```typescript
const hasFiredProjectOpened = useRef(false);
useEffect(() => {
  if (!backlog.isLoading && !hasFiredProjectOpened.current) {
    hasFiredProjectOpened.current = true;
    track('project_opened', {
      has_items: items.length > 0,
      item_count: items.length,
    });
  }
}, [backlog.isLoading, items.length]);
```

**2. `project_created`** — HANDLED BY PLAN 27-02.
Plan 27-02 owns App.tsx and fires `project_created` inside `handleProjectSelect` when `types && types.length > 0` (the actual creation point). Do NOT implement this event here.

**3. `ticket_created`** — in `ProjectWorkspace.tsx`
Location: Inside the `handleCreateItem` (or equivalent) callback, AFTER the item is successfully created/saved.
```typescript
track('ticket_created', {
  type: newItem.typeId,
  via: 'editor', // or 'ai' / 'quick_capture' depending on origin
});
```
Look for the function that handles saving a new item from the editor modal. Add `track()` after the DB insert succeeds. The `via` property should be 'editor' for manual creation. If the item was AI-generated, the AI module will fire `ai_generation_completed` separately — the `ticket_created` event just tracks that a ticket was persisted.

**4. `ai_generation_completed`** — in `src/lib/ai.ts`
Location: After a successful AI generation returns. Look for the function that calls the AI provider and returns the generated item(s). Add after the response is successfully parsed:
```typescript
track('ai_generation_completed', {
  provider: getProvider(), // or the provider name from config
  type: 'ticket', // or 'refinement' or 'bulk' depending on the function
});
```
The `getProvider()` function already exists in ai.ts. Use it to get the current provider name.

**5. `ai_generation_failed`** — in `src/lib/ai.ts`
Location: In the catch block of AI generation. Use the error classification from ai-health.ts if available, otherwise use generic error type:
```typescript
track('ai_generation_failed', {
  provider: getProvider(),
  type: 'ticket',
  error_type: 'unknown', // classify if possible: 'auth' | 'rate_limit' | 'timeout' | 'network' | 'unknown'
});
```

**6. `view_switched`** — in `ProjectWorkspace.tsx`
Location: In the view mode switching handler (setViewMode or equivalent). Fire when the user changes between kanban/list/graph/dashboard/archive views:
```typescript
// Find where viewMode is changed and add:
track('view_switched', { to: newViewMode });
```
Look for the `setViewMode` call or the view tab click handler.

**7. `settings_opened`** — in `ProjectWorkspace.tsx`
Location: In the callbacks that open settings modals. There are multiple: onOpenSettings (app), onOpenAISettings (AI), onOpenTypeConfig, onOpenProjectSettings. Fire the event in each handler passed as props or where they're called:
```typescript
// For each settings open callback, add:
track('settings_opened', { panel: 'app' }); // or 'ai', 'type_config', 'project'
```
Since these callbacks come from App.tsx props, the simplest approach is to wrap them in ProjectWorkspace where they're used. Look for where `onOpenSettings()` is called (e.g., in the Header component callback) and add track() alongside it.

Actually, the settings handlers are passed as props from App.tsx. The cleanest place to instrument is where ProjectWorkspace calls them. Find the callback wiring in ProjectWorkspace (e.g., `openSettings: onOpenSettings` in the workspace actions) and wrap them:
```typescript
const handleOpenSettings = useCallback(() => {
  track('settings_opened', { panel: 'app' });
  onOpenSettings();
}, [onOpenSettings]);
```
Apply the same pattern for AI settings, type config, project settings.

**8. `ai_health_check_run`** — in `src/lib/ai-health.ts`
Location: At the end of the health check function (after the check completes), fire:
```typescript
import { track } from './telemetry';

// At the end of checkProviderHealth (or equivalent function), after getting the result:
track('ai_health_check_run', {
  provider: providerName,
  success: result.ok, // or result.status === 'ok'
  latency_ms: result.latencyMs, // if available
});
```
  </action>
  <verify>
`pnpm build` passes. `grep -r "track(" src/components/workspace/ProjectWorkspace.tsx src/lib/ai.ts src/lib/ai-health.ts` returns multiple matches. Each track() call is inside a callback or effect, never in the render body.
  </verify>
  <done>
6 of 10 core events are instrumented at their correct action points (project_opened, ticket_created, ai_generation_completed, ai_generation_failed, view_switched, settings_opened). The remaining 4 (app_launched, project_created, consent_granted, consent_revoked) are handled by Plan 27-02. ai_health_check_run is instrumented.
  </done>

  <name>Task 2: Instrument secondary events across UI components</name>
  <files>src/components/palette/CommandPalette.tsx, src/components/import/BulkImportWizard.tsx, src/components/onboarding/OnboardingWizard.tsx</files>
  <action>
Instrument the 5 secondary events from TELE-06. Import `import { track } from '../../lib/telemetry'` (adjust path as needed) in each file.

**1. `command_palette_opened`** — in `CommandPalette.tsx`
Location: In the effect or handler that runs when the palette opens (e.g., when isOpen becomes true, or in the open handler):
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isOpen) {
    track('command_palette_opened');
  }
}, [isOpen]);
```
Only fire when the palette opens, not on every render.

**2. `bulk_import_completed`** — in `BulkImportWizard.tsx`
Location: In the final step's completion handler, after items are successfully imported:
```typescript
track('bulk_import_completed', {
  items_imported: importedItems.length, // or the count of imported items
});
```
Look for the "finish" or "complete" handler in the wizard's final step.

**3. `onboarding_completed`** — in `OnboardingWizard.tsx`
Location: In the `onComplete` handler or the final step's "Get Started" button handler:
```typescript
track('onboarding_completed', {
  steps_completed: totalSteps, // or the number of steps the user went through
  ai_configured: hasConfiguredAI, // boolean if AI was set up during onboarding
});
```
Look for where `onComplete()` is called and add the track() before it.

**4. `dark_mode_toggled`** — HANDLED BY PLAN 27-02.
Plan 27-02 owns AppSettingsModal.tsx and adds `track('dark_mode_toggled', { theme: opt.value })` in the theme selector click handler. Do NOT implement this event here.

**5. `ai_health_check_run`** — already handled in Task 1 (src/lib/ai-health.ts). Skip here.

**So this task handles: command_palette_opened, bulk_import_completed, onboarding_completed.**

For each file:
- Import `track` from the telemetry module
- Add the track() call at the correct action point
- Ensure track() is in a callback/effect, never in a render path
- Include relevant context metadata

**BulkImportWizard.tsx** — look for the final import completion handler. It likely calls a function to persist the imported items. Add track() after the success callback fires. Use the count of items that were actually imported (not the total parsed).

**OnboardingWizard.tsx** — look for the complete/finish handler. The wizard has 7 steps. Track how many the user completed and whether AI was configured. Look for a state variable tracking AI setup completion.

**CommandPalette.tsx** — the simplest: fire when the palette opens. Use a useEffect watching the `isOpen` prop.
  </action>
  <verify>
`pnpm build` passes. `grep -r "track(" src/components/palette/CommandPalette.tsx src/components/import/BulkImportWizard.tsx src/components/onboarding/OnboardingWizard.tsx` returns at least one match per file.
  </verify>
  <done>
3 secondary events are instrumented (command_palette_opened, bulk_import_completed, onboarding_completed). dark_mode_toggled is handled by Plan 27-02 (which owns AppSettingsModal.tsx). ai_health_check_run was handled in Task 1.
  </done>
</task>
